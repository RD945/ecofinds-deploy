## Introduction (0:00 - 0:15)
**[Screen: Landing page with hero section]**

"Welcome to EcoFinds, a full-stack sustainable e-commerce marketplace that I built from the ground up. This project demonstrates a complete development lifecycle, showcasing modern web technologies and best practices in building a production-ready application."

## Project Overview (0:15 - 0:30)
**[Screen: System architecture diagram]**

"EcoFinds is designed as a marketplace for eco-conscious consumers to buy and sell sustainable products. The application features a React frontend, Express.js backend, and PostgreSQL database, all containerized with Docker for easy deployment and development."

## Technology Stack (0:30 - 0:45)
**[Screen: Split view showing frontend and backend code]**

"The frontend is built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, styled with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components for a modern, responsive design. The backend uses Node.js with Express.js, Prisma ORM for database management, and JWT authentication for security."

## Key Features Demo (0:45 - 2:00)

### User Authentication (0:45 - 1:00)
**[Screen: Auth page with login/signup forms]**

"Let's start with the authentication system. Users can register, login, and even enable two-factor authentication for enhanced security. The system includes password reset functionality with secure email links."

### Product Discovery (1:00 - 1:15)
**[Screen: Landing page with product grid]**

"The main landing page showcases products with a beautiful hero section and responsive product grid. Users can search by keywords and filter by categories like kitchen, electronics, personal care, and more."

### Product Detail View (1:15 - 1:30)
**[Screen: Product detail page with image gallery]**

"Each product has a detailed view with comprehensive information including condition, brand, dimensions, and materials. The image gallery supports multiple photos with thumbnail navigation, similar to Amazon's interface."

### Shopping Cart (1:30 - 1:45)
**[Screen: Cart page with items]**

"The shopping cart allows users to add, remove, and adjust quantities. Product images are properly displayed, and the cart persists across sessions."

### User Dashboard (1:45 - 2:00)
**[Screen: Dashboard with user's products and orders]**

"The user dashboard provides a personalized view where sellers can manage their product listings and buyers can review their purchase history."

## Advanced Features (2:00 - 2:30)

### Product Management (2:00 - 2:15)
**[Screen: Add/Edit product forms]**

"Users can create detailed product listings with multiple images, comprehensive product details, and even specify dimensions and materials. The system supports both external image URLs and direct file uploads."

### Order Processing (2:15 - 2:30)
**[Screen: Checkout process and order confirmation]**

"The checkout process includes delivery location selection and converts cart items into persistent orders. Email notifications are sent for order confirmations and cart additions."

## Technical Implementation (2:30 - 3:00)

### Database Design (2:30 - 2:45)
**[Screen: Database schema diagram]**

"The PostgreSQL database uses a well-designed relational schema with proper foreign key relationships. The system handles users, products, categories, cart items, and orders with full referential integrity."

### Security Features (2:45 - 3:00)
**[Screen: Code snippets showing JWT and validation]**

"Security is implemented throughout with JWT tokens, password hashing using bcrypt, input validation with Zod schemas, and protected routes. The system also includes two-factor authentication and secure password reset flows."

## Development Challenges & Solutions (3:00 - 3:30)
**[Screen: Code examples and error handling]**

"During development, I encountered and solved several challenges including connection issues between frontend and backend, database seeding problems, navigation state management, and image handling for both external URLs and uploaded files. Each challenge taught me valuable lessons about full-stack development."

## Project Structure & Best Practices (3:30 - 3:45)
**[Screen: File structure and code organization]**

"The project follows industry best practices with clear separation of concerns, centralized API management, proper error handling, and responsive design. The codebase is well-organized with dedicated folders for components, services, and utilities."

## Conclusion (3:45 - 4:00)
**[Screen: Final overview of the application]**

"EcoFinds represents a complete, production-ready e-commerce application that demonstrates proficiency in modern web development technologies. From authentication and product management to shopping cart functionality and order processing, every aspect has been carefully implemented with attention to user experience and code quality."

## Recording Tips:

1. **Pace**: Speak clearly and at a moderate pace (about 150-160 words per minute)
2. **Transitions**: Use smooth transitions between sections
3. **Screen Recording**: Show the actual application running, not just static screenshots
4. **Code Examples**: When showing code, zoom in enough to make it readable
5. **Demo Flow**: Follow the user journey from landing page through to checkout
6. **Technical Details**: Balance technical depth with accessibility for different audiences

## Total Runtime: Approximately 4 minutes
