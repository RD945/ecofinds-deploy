The above diagram illustrates the complete system architecture, showing the flow of data between the frontend React application, backend Express.js API, and PostgreSQL database with Docker containerization.

## Key Features

*   **Complete User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login functionality using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
*   **Product Listings**: Users can create, read, update, and delete their own product listings.
*   **Product Discovery**: Browse a full catalog of products with support for searching by keyword and filtering by category.
*   **Shopping Cart**: A fully functional shopping cart where users can add, view, and remove items with proper image display.
*   **Order Management**: A simulated checkout process that converts a user's cart into a persistent order.
*   **User Dashboard**: A personalized dashboard where users can view their product listings and review their purchase history.
*   **Relational Database**: Built on a robust PostgreSQL database with a well-defined, relational schema.
*   **Secure Image Uploads**: Users can upload multiple images for their products, which are stored securely as binary data directly in the PostgreSQL database.
*   **Advanced Security**:
    *   **Forgot Password**: A complete password reset flow via secure, one-time email links.
    *   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Users can enable email-based OTPs for an extra layer of security upon login.
*   **Detailed Product Information**: Products can be listed with extensive details, including condition, brand, model, dimensions, materials, and more.
*   **Dynamic Image Gallery**: A responsive, Amazon-style image gallery on the product detail page with thumbnail navigation.
*   **Enhanced Image Handling**: 
    *   **Dual Image Support**: Supports both external URL-based images (for seeded data) and blob-stored images (for user uploads).
    *   **Image API**: Robust image serving API that handles redirects for external images and blob serving for uploaded images.
    *   **Cart Image Display**: Fixed cart functionality to properly display product images with fallback handling.
*   **Modern UI Components**: Built with shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS for a professional, responsive design.
*   **Email Integration**: Complete email system for password resets, 2FA codes, and payment confirmations.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the entire application running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js (version 16 or later) installed.
*   **Docker Desktop**: You must have Docker Desktop installed and running to manage the local PostgreSQL database.

### 1. Backend Setup

First, set up and start the backend server.

```bash
# 1. Navigate into the backend directory
cd backend

# 2. Install all required dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the PostgreSQL database using Docker
# This will start a container in the background.
docker-compose up -d

# 4. Set up the database tables and seed them with sample data
# This command wipes the database, applies migrations, and runs the seed script.
npx prisma migrate reset --force

# 5. Start the backend server
# The API will now be running at http://localhost:5000
npm run dev
```
**Important:** You must leave the terminal from Step 5 running. This process is your live backend server.

### 2. Frontend Setup

Now, in a **new, separate terminal window**, set up and start the frontend application.

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the project's root directory
# (If you are in the 'backend' directory, go back one level)
cd ..

# 2. Install all required dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the frontend development server
# The application will now be running, likely at http://localhost:8080
npm run dev
```
You can now open your browser to the local URL provided by Vite to use the application.

## Recent Improvements & Bug Fixes

### Cart Image Display Fix (Latest Update)

**Issue**: Product images were not displaying in the shopping cart, showing "No image" placeholders instead.

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **Backend Cart Service**: The cart API wasn't including product images in the response
2. **Image API Route**: The image serving endpoint couldn't handle both external URLs (seeded images) and blob data (uploaded images)
3. **Frontend Image Handling**: Cart component wasn't using the same robust image handling as other components

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Enhanced Cart Service**: Updated `getCart` function to include product images with proper relations
2. **Improved Image API**: Modified `/api/images/:id` endpoint to handle both image types:
   - External URLs: Redirects to the original image source
   - Blob Data: Serves binary image data with proper MIME types
3. **Frontend Improvements**: 
   - Updated cart component to use `ImageWithFade` component for consistent image handling
   - Added comprehensive error logging for debugging image loading issues
   - Improved fallback handling for products without images

**Technical Details**:
- Cart now receives products with full image arrays instead of single image URLs
- Image API supports both seeded products (with external URLs) and user-uploaded products (with blob storage)
- Added proper error handling and debugging capabilities for image loading

## Development Journey & Troubleshooting Guide

During the development of this project, we encountered several common but critical bugs. This section documents them in detail to serve as a learning reference.

### 1. The "Connection Refused" Error

*   **The Problem**: The most persistent issue was the `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` error in the browser console. The frontend was unable to communicate with the backend API.
*   **The Root Cause**: This error has a very specific meaning: the backend server process was not running. Even though we had fixed all the code, the server would often crash silently on startup due to a new error, or the process was simply not started.
*   **The Solution**: The solution was twofold:
    1.  **Systematic Debugging**: We fixed a cascade of TypeScript compilation errors in the backend that were causing it to crash. These included missing type definitions (`@types/jsonwebtoken`), incorrect Zod error handling (`error.issues` vs. `error.errors`), and incorrect data shapes for Prisma relations.
    2.  **Running Processes Correctly**: We established a clear workflow: the backend server (`npm run dev` in the `/backend` folder) and the frontend server (`npm run dev` in the root folder) must be running simultaneously in **separate, dedicated terminal windows**. The backend process must be left running to serve the API.

### 2. Database Connection and Seeding Issues

*   **The Problem**: We faced an issue where Prisma could not connect to the database, and later, the product listings were incorrect (duplicates, missing images, wrong currency).
*   **The Root Cause**:
    1.  **Port Mismatch**: The `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file was initially pointing to the wrong port, so Prisma could not find the PostgreSQL instance running in Docker.
    2.  **Stale Data**: After fixing bugs or changing the desired sample data, the database still contained the old information.
*   **The Solution**:
    1.  We corrected the `.env` file to use port `5432`, matching the `docker-compose.yml` configuration.
    2.  We created and used a robust database seeding script (`prisma/seed.ts`). To apply data changes, we used the `npx prisma migrate reset --force` command, which is a powerful tool for development that wipes the database, re-applies all migrations, and runs the seed script, ensuring the database is always in a clean and predictable state.

### 3. Faulty Navigation and State Management

*   **The Problem**: The application's navigation was buggy. The browser's back button didn't work, and sometimes navigating would cause errors. Furthermore, after logging in and refreshing the page, the user's information would be lost or replaced with placeholder data.
*   **The Root Cause**: The initial version of the app used a brittle, manual routing system based on React state. This is an anti-pattern that fights against the browser's natural history and does not handle state persistence well.
*   **The Solution**: We performed a major refactor to adopt industry best practices:
    1.  **Centralized Routing**: We replaced the manual system with `react-router-dom`, defining all routes in `App.tsx`.
    2.  **Protected Routes**: We created a `<ProtectedRoute />` component to handle authentication checks declaratively.
    3.  **Real-time User Data**: We created a `/api/auth/me` endpoint on the backend. Now, the `AuthContext` on the frontend calls this endpoint on page load, using the stored JWT to fetch the latest user data. This ensures that the user's state is always accurate and persists across refreshes.

### 4. Seed Script Foreign Key Constraint Violations

*   **The Problem**: The database seeding script (`npx prisma db seed`) would frequently fail with a `P2003 Foreign key constraint violated` error. This meant the script was trying to delete a record that was still being referenced by another record in a different table.
*   **The Root Cause**: When clearing data from a relational database, you must delete records in the reverse order of their creation and dependencies. For example, you cannot delete a `Product` if an `OrderItem` still exists that points to it. Our initial seed script did not respect this strict ordering.
*   **The Solution**: The fix was to meticulously re-order the `deleteMany` operations in `prisma/seed.ts`. The correct deletion order must start from the "bottom" of the dependency chain and work its way up. The final, correct order is: `OrderItem`, `CartItem`, `ProductImage`, `Order`, `Product`, `User`, `Category`. This ensures that by the time the script tries to delete a `Product`, for instance, all records that depend on it have already been removed.

By systematically diagnosing and fixing these issues, we transformed the application from a buggy prototype into a robust and reliable full-stack project.
